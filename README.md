# Logistic-Map
## Project written in Python that shows the chaos in the logistic map by some examples and its bifurcation diagram. It also finds the Feigenbaum constants δ and α.

The logistic map is a polynomial mapping that exhibits complex, chaotic behavior for certain values of the parameter r. The Feigenbaum constants are two mathematical constants that express the ratios of bifurcation intervals and cycle elements in the logistic map. They are named after the physicist Mitchell J. Feigenbaum, who discovered them in 1975.
